Ranking the attempted solutions based on their performance in terms of time taken to execute the matrix multiplication depends on various factors such as the size of the matrices, the speed of the system. However, based on general assumptions, the ranking can be as follows:

Using two threads to solve the matrix multiplication, where the first thread solves the first n/2 matrix and the second thread solves the remaining n/2 matrix, is likely to be the fastest solution. This is because dividing the work into two separate threads allows for parallel execution, which can reduce the overall execution time.

Using n*n threads to perform the matrix multiplication can also improve the performance compared to using a single thread, but it may not be the best solution in all cases. The performance gain is dependent on the hardware configuration of the system, as well as the overhead associated with creating and managing multiple threads.

Using a single thread to perform matrix multiplication is likely to be the slowest solution, as it does not take advantage of parallelism and can result in a longer execution time, especially for large matrices.

Overall, the ranking of the solutions based on their performance may vary depending on the specifics of the size and system speed and specs.
