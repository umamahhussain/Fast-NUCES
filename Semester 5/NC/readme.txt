   Using MATLAB and Maple

For installation instructions, licensing information, and system 
requirements, refer to the Install.htm file at the top level of 
the Maple 7 CD.


Command Line Maple 
------------------
 
Command Line Maple provides you with full access to the Maple library
and kernel, but it uses a character-based interface. Command Line
Maple uses slightly less memory than standard Maple.

On any Windows platform, Command Line Maple can be accessed from the 
Start menu. (If you installed Maple in the default location, fromthe 
Start menu, choose Programs, then Maple 7, then Command Line Maple.)
This version of Maple is described in the file Cmdline.txt. 

If the Command Line version of Maple (cmaple) does not appear to 
start, start the GUI (worksheet) version to check for messages 
regarding startup problems.


Changing User Mode or Folder
----------------------------

The BIN folder under the MAPLE folder contains an ASCII text file 
called Maplesys.ini. System administrators can use this file after 
installation to change user profile information. To change Maple 
from Single to Multiple User Mode, change the MultiUserProfile 
option from 0 to 1. To change the location of the user directory, 
specify the new directory in the UserDirectory option.


Using MATLAB and Maple
----------------------

MATLAB is an interactive system and programming language for general 
scientific and technical computation. For information on using the 
Maple-MATLAB link, see the ?Matlab,setup help page in Maple 7.
